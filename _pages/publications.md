    Abstract:This study examines the impact of public coverage for prescribed drugs, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan Plus (OHIP+) implemented in 2018 in Ontario, Canada, on the utilization of emergency department by those eligible and those non eligible. The findings indicate that the implementation of OHIP+ reduced the likelihood of emergency department visits for some eligible individuals (those aged 18-24 from low-income families). In particular, this reduction in emergency department (ED) visits was primarily driven by non-Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition cases. On the other hand, the likelihood of ED visits increased for individuals living in non-low income families (whether eligible or not to OHIP+), something I attribute to a crowding-out effect in primary care.

    Abstract: This study explores the effect of increases in the minimum wage on the probability of receiving supplementary health insurance through the workplace in Canada: Do Canadian employers respond to higher minimum wage by reducing supplementary health insurance coverage? We use survey data from waves 2011 to 2018 of the Canadian Community Health Survey and self-reports on supplementary health insurance of employed individuals. A triple-differences model exploits the fact that decisions on the level of the minimum wage are made by provincial governments. The findings suggest that an increase in the minimum wage decreases the likelihood of employer-sponsored dental insurance among workers earning slightly more than the minimum wage.
