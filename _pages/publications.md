Abstract: This study explores the effect of increases in the minimum wage on the probability of receiving supplementary health insurance through the workplace in Canada: Do Canadian employers respond to higher minimum wage by reducing supplementary health insurance coverage? We use survey data from waves 2011 to 2018 of the Canadian Community Health Survey and self-reports on supplementary health insurance of employed individuals. A triple-differences model exploits the fact that decisions on the level of the minimum wage are made by provincial governments. The findings suggest that an increase in the minimum wage decreases the likelihood of employer-sponsored dental insurance among workers earning slightly more than the minimum wage.
